This app uses node-windows (https://github.com/coreybutler/node-windows) which creates a Windows service for running the bot. Configuration is in config.json.

To install the service:
node install-windows-service.js

To uninstall the service:
node uninstall-windows-service.js

The app should still run using:
node app.js

As a service, the app sends log information to the Windows Event Viewer. You can control the service (start/stop/restart) in the Windows Services menu.

Use the Task Scheduler to restart the service every hour on the hour, in case of locks or other problems.
